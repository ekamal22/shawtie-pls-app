# Shawtie pls

Shawtie pls is a privacy-focused two-person communication platform built around one active partnership at a time.

The repository has completed its verified foundation milestones. Architecture Baseline 1.0 is frozen; F0 Governance and Security Baseline, F1 Repository Foundation, and F2 Persistence and Worker Foundation are DONE locally. A1 Accounts and Devices has committed runtime implementation across domain rules, contracts, migration 0007, database repositories, Fastify authentication/security, account APIs, durable worker handlers, verification suites, a disposable PostgreSQL harness, a runnable API entrypoint, and the mobile-first account/device web foundation. Core A1 local validation is now green: all seven migrations apply from zero, database invariants pass, `npm run test:a1:local` passes 9/9, and `npm run health` passes. A1 remains IN_PROGRESS at 19/20 acceptance gates because the canonical A1 test matrix still requires additional dedicated database/API/security coverage before the final integration-and-security gate may close.

## Product direction

The product combines:

- private one-to-one messaging
- media and voice messages
- voice and video calls
- a private relationship space
- breakup and account-deletion lifecycle rules
- strong partnership isolation
- PWA-first delivery
- reviewed end-to-end encryption before stable release

## Architecture

The selected architecture is:

- React and TypeScript PWA
- Fastify and TypeScript modular monolith
- separate durable worker
- PostgreSQL as the authoritative transactional state store
- transactional outbox
- durable scheduled actions
- capability-based domain authorization
- partnership-scoped local storage
- client-side encrypted media
- WebSockets for realtime synchronization and call signaling
- WebRTC with relay-first TURN support
- reviewed E2EE with per-device and per-partnership cryptographic state

## Documentation

Start with:

- `docs/README.md` for document authority and navigation
- `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` for verified current implementation state
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the regenerated milestone-by-milestone execution sequence
- `docs/architecture/A1_ACCOUNTS_DEVICES_DESIGN.md` for the active A1 implementation design
- `docs/ROADMAP_EPICS.md` for epic status and acceptance gates
- `docs/product/PRD.md` for product requirements
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE.md` for the frozen architecture baseline
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md` for structural change control
- `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md` and `docs/security/DATA_CLASSIFICATION.md` for security boundaries
- `docs/testing/TEST_STRATEGY.md` for verification requirements
- `docs/testing/CI_AND_REPOSITORY_HEALTH.md` for current CI and repository-health status
- `docs/database/MIGRATIONS.md` for PostgreSQL migration policy and verification

Architecture and product documents describe intended rules and design. `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `ROADMAP_EPICS.md` are the living sources for what is actually implemented and what remains.

## Canonical bootstrap

Use Node.js 22.18.0 or newer.

From a clean clone, the canonical dependency bootstrap command is:

```text
npm ci
```

After bootstrap, run the complete local repository baseline:

```text
npm run health
```

`npm ci` is the supported clean-install path because the repository commits `package-lock.json`.

## Repository rule

Every committed byte should be treated as permanently public.

Do not commit:

- real private messages
- real relationship data
- private user media
- secrets
- credentials
- private cryptographic material
- production database exports
- personal operational notes

Use synthetic data only.


## Architecture governance

Architecture Baseline 1.0 is frozen.

Implementation should follow the accepted baseline. Structural changes require evidence and an accepted ADR before implementation, except for emergency security mitigation.

See `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_GOVERNANCE.md`.
